I would like you to do a report on the digital divide which is the effect of or
the fact of people in poor areas having less access to the Internet having less
lower down speeds or just fewer options in mobile or fixed Internet one thing
we're interested in. We're doing some data analysis and we're interested in how
this has changed over time. What were the original conditions of what people
called the digital divide maybe 25 years ago so starting around 2000 was there a
big gap in the availability of Internet access for people of different incomes
and how has that changed over time we are doing a scientific paper so we are
interested in having research reports we need to have primary research other
things like you know personal experience or or news articles are interesting,
but we're mostly focused on primary research primary data and we'd like you to
make an emphasis to find data sets and again we want to explore the scope of how
this has existed over the last 25 years from 2000 year 2002 today and understand
what the changes are and then we need to assess what the current situation is.
